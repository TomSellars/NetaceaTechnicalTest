# NetaceaTechnicalTest
The Technical task presented was to:
- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

The task will be completed through a for loop that will loop 100 times and then for each integer of the loop will check to see if it meets the requirements for "FizzBuzz", "Fizz" or "Buzz" if none of these conditions are met then the integer will be printed.
